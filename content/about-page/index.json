  "body": "I'm Alexis Sara, a multi award winning writer \\[Nebula, Eisener, and more] who works across different mediums of writing. My works include Table Top Role Playing Games like Thristy Sword Lesbains and comics like Puerto Rico Strong. As well as diversity consulting work including the Eisner winning series Princeless.  I believe in strongly creating stories that are centering people like me and in particular Lesbains. As a Trans, Puerto Rican, Asexual, Disabled, lesbian I am a big \"diversity ball\" and I am proud of all the aspects of myself. I want to create a world full of marglized stories and use that as a path to a better more inclusive and loving society.  My love of telling stories started when I was a kid and I never lost the drive.&#x20;\n"
